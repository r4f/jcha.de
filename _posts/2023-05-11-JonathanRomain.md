**Rabbiner Jonathan Romain PhD**
Berkshire, England

When you want to die, but the law won’t let you. If you ask most rabbis, they will tell you that Judaism opposes assisted dying, claiming it offends against the sanctity of life and usurps God’s will. But is that true? Even if that might have been the case in the past, should that still apply today for those terminally ill and in great pain? What sanctity is there in suffering? We are constantly playing God in other forms of medicine, so why not here too? Is it time to change Jewish attitudes?
